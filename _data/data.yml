    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have devoted a lot of time to engineering not only in the classroom 
      where this time got me to the top of my class in my final year but also 
      out of in through expanding my skills by collaborating with other on their 
      projects or by working on side projects of my own. Side projects that have 
      even gone so far as to allow me to have had a steady flow of contract work 
      over the years. This devotion to my craft has expanded my skillset through 
      giving me opportunities to design PCB’s or learn machining to become a 
      better designer. It has also given me the opportunity to pass on this 
      knowledge through my work as a TA a role that also pushed me into a 
      leadership position in managing a set of tutors working under me.

        I am currently completing a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering 
        specialising in robotics. This is a research only MSc where I have been 
        working on rapidly accelerating robots using a hybrid electric-pneumatic 
        approach. For this masters my work has been recognised through my receiving 
        of a VC Research Scholarship and the Ada & Bertie Levenstein Bursary.
