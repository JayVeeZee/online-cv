career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I have devoted a lot of time to engineering not only in the classroom 
      where this time got me to the top of my class in my final year but also 
      out of in through expanding my skills by collaborating with other on their 
      projects or by working on side projects of my own. Side projects that have 
      even gone so far as to allow me to have had a steady flow of contract work 
      over the years. This devotion to my craft has expanded my skillset through 
      giving me opportunities to design PCBâ€™s or learn machining to become a 
      better designer. It has also given me the opportunity to pass on this 
      knowledge through my work as a TA a role that also pushed me into a 
      leadership position in managing a set of tutors working under me.  
education:
    - degree: MSc in Electrical Engineering
      university: University of Cape Town
      time: 2019 - Present
      details: |
        I am currently completing a Masters degree in Electrical Engineering 
        specialising in robotics. This is a research only MSc where I have been 
        working on rapidly accelerating robots using a hybrid electric-pneumatic 
        approach. For this masters my work has been recognised through my receiving 
        of a Vice-Chancellors Research Scholarship for Academic Excellence and the 
        Ada & Bertie Levenstein Bursary.
    - degree: BSc in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering
      university: University of Cape Town
      time: 2014 - 2018
      details: |
        I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering 
        in minimum time while receiving a Dean's list award each year for academic 
        excellence. In addition to this I finished with 1st class honours and being 
        top of my class for my final year.
experiences:
    - role: Intern
      time: 2015 - 2015 
      company: Thermopower Furnaces
      details: |
        In my time as an intern at thermopower furnaces a lot about high power and 
        high risk systems in addition to working with multiple stakeholders to reach a 
        solution at meets the criteria of all involved.
    - role: Teaching Assistant
      time: 2019 - 2020
      company: University of Cape Town
      details: |
        In my capacity of a teaching assistant not only did I have the responsibility 
        of being a front facing role towards a class up to 250 but also I managed a 
        team of tutors in both an administrative and face to face role. Furthermore it 
        allowed me to pass on my knowledge and experience to another generation of 
        engineers.
